# 1 Introduction

This assignment covers the black box testing of several methods of the JFreeChart library. We use Equivalence Class Testing and Boundary Value Testing techniques to develop test cases, implemented using JUnit. The methods tested are within the Range and DataUtilities classes.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

The test strategy for each method is to apply ECT to determine partitions and develop a list of potential tests using the Strong ECT principle. Subgroups of those tests were then implemented using the BVT method. This strategy follows the instructions provided by the professor through email who indicated the test plan should be exhaustive but only a subset of test cases should be implemented in code to demonstrate understanding.

As instructed by the professor, the Range constructor parameters are also considered inputs for each tested Range method. However, the Javadocs do not make any domain boundaries for the constructor obvious beyond the constraint of upper being greater or equal to lower. To cover potential bugs due to sign errors, a partition boundary was added between positive and negative constructor parameter values, such that testing scenarios would include range objects instantiated with both negative parameters, one negative and one positive parameter, and both positive parameters.

The documentation for the DataUtilities class did not contain specifications regarding allowable input ranges for its functions, it was only indicated that invalid inputs (null values) should result in an Invalid Parameter Exception. Because of this, each function was tested for two cases: input of valid parameters and input of invalid parameters (null). In the case of DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal and DataUtilities.calculateRowTotal, an extra test was conducted for out-of-bounds index values. However, properly testing this scenario using mock variables presented challenges, which will be elaborated upon in the Difficulties section of the report.

## Pros and Cons of Mocking

Mocking can be a valuable tool for testing as it allows the unit undergoing testing to be isolated from external dependencies. This isolation ensures that test results remain solely influenced by the unit's behavior and not by external sources that may contain their own errors. Mocking can enhance testing efficiency by eliminating the need for network calls and database queries, thereby reducing test duration. By providing controlled data inputs and outputs, mocking can mitigate external uncertainties and facilitate the creation of predictable data that can be easily verified. On the other hand, consistency between mock data and real data is not always guaranteed. Inconsistencies in data representation can introduce false positives or false negatives into the testing results. When mocking is used the true behavior of the system is not being tested, reducing the confidence that tests are producing representative results. The extra code and logic required to implement mocks can also increase the overall complexity of the test.

## Equivalence Testing

The equivalence classes for each tested method are listed below.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Team collaborated to create a general test plan. The template for the tabular representation of Equivalence and Boundary Value Testing was developed in order to keep the report clear and concise. Once this was completed, methods to test were split between group members and each worked individually.

Working as a team of four made it difficult to ensure that each team memeber was understanding every aspect of the testing in this assignment. This was overcome by working as a team to have frequent meetings where teammates were informed of progress including explainations and questions on how each part was developed. This ensured all team memebers understood all aspects of the completed project.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Black-Box testing made the implementation of Range classes difficult. Strictly following the dcoumentation and treating the methods as a black-box made it tricky exploring different ways to cause failures/errors within the methods. In some cases it was difficult to determine whether a failure was due to a bug in the code or intended as there were certain qualities that were not specified in the documentation.

We found setting up the mock contexts difficult, since it is hard to know what data or methods the method under test will call. For instance, we had to use trial and error to discover that DataUtilities.calculateRowTotal calls getColumnCount on the Values2D object. With blackbox testing, it is hard to anticipate what functions to add to the mocking context.

Based on the context of the DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal function and DataUtilities.calculateRowTotal function it seemed like the index parameter should be tested for situations where an out of bonds index is used. However, the documentation did not explicitly specify what should occur if this were to happen making it very difficult to test. Additionally, when attempting to create a test case for this situation it was found that the first error that is thrown is a jmock exception which means the mock variable is catching the error and not the function. A test case was included for out of bounds indexes but since a mock variable had to be used it the test is not a reflection of what would occur using the real a parameter object.

The documentation for the DataUtilities functions specified that an InvalidParameterException should be thrown if an invalid data object is passed in. When attempting to test invalid parameters it was found that exceptions that did not match the documentation were thrown instead causing every invalid input test to result in errors. This could be an indication that the functions did not include proper invalid input handling but it was hard to say for certain using blackbox testing.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Understanding the scope of work requested was difficult. An email to the professor was required to understand how exhaustive the test plan and JUnit test cases should be. The documentation was vague and trying to determine whether a failure was due to out of scope inputs or a bug in the code was difficult.
